# Donoff
A Sonoff firmware alternative.

The first project of getting my hands dirty with the ESP8266 and Sonoff using Arduino IDE.

Based on projects of KmanOz and El Ape.

Features:
* Creates AP on the first startup
* Allows to configure WiFi credentials and MQTT server
* Allows OTA upgrade
* OTA authentication password is the same as WiFi's PSK
* Resets on a long (5s) button press

Notes:
* Might require resoldering Sonoff flash chip to a more spacious one (1 MB vs. 4 MB)
